# Averager
A simple web application I developed and deployed in 2015 to solve a simple problem and practice JavaScript programming.

## Usage
This application provides a user (e.g. a student) with the ability to determine their total grade average in real-time with a clean and responsive UI. By filling in their grades and weights, by assignment and by course, you can put away your calculator and let Averager do the work for you. The site also uses cookies, allowing the user to return and update their grades at a later time.
